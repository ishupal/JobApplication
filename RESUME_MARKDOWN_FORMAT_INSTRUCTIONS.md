## KEY FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Career Profile
- **MUST** be in first person ("I", "my", "me")
- **MUST** be a single large paragraph (5-7 sentences, no line breaks)
- **MUST** include "I specialize in..." type statement
- **MUST** end with motivation/drive statement like "What drives me is..."
- Style: Conversational but professional, shows personality

Example:
> "Data and AI leader with 13 years building analytics capabilities that deliver insights driving action, not just dashboards collecting dust. I specialize in AI powered solutions that surface personalized, context aware insights tailored to specific business challenges. My strength is balancing strategic vision with hands-on execution: shaping insights direction while building the platforms, governance frameworks, and teams that deliver them. I lead cross functional teams through enterprise transformations, translating generative AI and machine learning into solutions that reveal patterns traditional analysis misses. What drives me is identifying where emerging technologies can solve business problems in ways that weren't possible before, turning operational and regulatory challenges into strategic advantages."

### 2. Areas of Expertise
- **Exactly 3 areas**
- Each has **bold title** followed by **paragraph** (NOT bullets)
- Paragraphs are 2-3 sentences explaining depth and approach
- Include specific technologies and outcomes

### 3. Career Summary
- **List ALL jobs** (even brief/early ones)
- Format: Title, Department, Company {lots of spaces} Dates
- **NO descriptions or bullets** - just the listing
- Chronological order (most recent first)

### 4. Work Experience - THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION

#### Role Detail Levels:
**Recent/Major Roles (1-3 most recent important roles):**
- 3-4 paragraphs describing responsibilities
- 4-5 achievement bullets

**Mid-Level Roles (next 2-3 roles):**
- 1-2 paragraphs describing responsibilities
- 2-3 achievement bullets

**Older/Brief Roles (remaining roles):**
- 1 paragraph only (no separate achievements section)
- Summarize key contributions in the paragraph

#### Critical Rule: Paragraphs vs Bullets
- **Responsibilities** = PARAGRAPHS (full sentences, descriptive)
- **Achievements** = BULLETS (with specific metrics)

**Example of CORRECT format:**
```
### Data and AI Insights Lead, Customer Complaints                            Dec 2023 - Present
**ANZ | Melbourne, Australia**

Lead team of 11 data professionals delivering enterprise analytics and regulatory reporting, establishing best-practice governance for Tableau visualization standards across retail operations.

Partner with executive, compliance, and technical stakeholders to translate regulatory requirements into delivery roadmaps. Use advanced SQL and data modeling concepts to transform raw compliance data into strategic business opportunities.

**Achievements**
- Built CRAIG, reducing manual analysis time by 80% using Claude API and SBERT models
- Architected cloud analytics platform processing 1M+ records daily
```

**Example of WRONG format:**
```
### Data Lead                                                                  Dec 2023 - Present
**ANZ | Melbourne, Australia**

- Lead team of 11 professionals     ❌ (responsibilities should be paragraphs)
- Partner with stakeholders          ❌ (not bullets)
- Oversee delivery of reports        ❌ (not bullets)

**Achievements**
Built CRAIG tool for analysis        ❌ (achievements should BE bullets)
Architected cloud platform           ❌ (missing bullet, missing metrics)
```

### 5. Education
- Format: `University  -   Date range` (note spacing with dashes)
- Next line: Degree and specialization (no prefix like "Bachelor of")
- Example format is correct

### 6. Skills
- **Grouped by category** (5-6 categories typical)
- Category name is **bold**
- Skills are **comma-separated** (NOT bullets, NOT newlines for each skill)
- Common categories: AI/ML, Cloud Platforms, Programming, BI Tools, Data Engineering, Governance

**Example of CORRECT format:**
```
**AI & Machine Learning**
Generative AI (Claude, RAG), Machine Learning, NLP, LLM Implementation, Vector Databases

**Programming & Analytics**
SQL, Python, Excel VBA, JavaScript
```

**Example of WRONG format:**
```
**Skills:**
- Python          ❌ (no category grouping)
- SQL             ❌ (bullets instead of comma-separated)
- Machine Learning ❌ (not grouped)
```

## METRICS AND QUANTIFICATION

**Every achievement bullet MUST include specific metrics:**
- Percentages (reduced by 80%, improved by 35%)
- Time savings (from hours to minutes)
- Scale (1M+ records, team of 11 people)
- Before/after comparisons
- Technologies used

**Good examples:**
- "Reduced manual analysis time by 80% (from hours to minutes) using Claude API and SBERT models"
- "Accelerated team delivery by 35% through implementing Agile practices"
- "Architected platform processing 1M+ records daily"

**Bad examples:**
- "Improved team performance" (no metric)
- "Built a tool" (no impact measurement, no technology)
- "Worked on cloud migration" (no outcome)

---

## TONE AND VOICE

**Career Profile Section:**
- First person ("I specialize...", "What drives me...")
- Conversational and personal
- Show passion and motivation

**All Other Sections:**
- Implied third person (active voice but no "I")
- Example: "Lead team of 11..." (not "I lead")
- Professional but not stiff
- Strong action verbs

---

## SECTION ORDERING (FIXED - DO NOT CHANGE)

1. Header (Name, Title, Contact Info)
2. CAREER PROFILE
3. AREAS OF EXPERTISE
4. CAREER SUMMARY
5. Work Experience
6. Education
7. Skills
8. References

This order must be maintained for template compatibility.

---

## SPACING AND ALIGNMENT

- Job titles and dates need LOTS of spaces between them to align right in template
- Company | Location uses pipe separator with spaces
- Career Summary dates also need spacing to align right
- Skills categories don't need special spacing (just comma-separated)
